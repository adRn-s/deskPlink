Description: A shiny graphical user interface (GUI) is available by calling the
          function: "run()". This enables users to input a VCF-formatted file
          (genetic information) and a table as comma separated values (CSV),
          with quantitative and/ or categorical variables as columns and rows
          matching each of the samples. Names in VCF and CSV need to match
          1:1. PLINK is a variant association analysis toolset, designed to
          perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally
          efficient manner. For more information please refer to upstream
          documentation at: https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink
